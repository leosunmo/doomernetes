                          instead of default.cfg.

                          x%. If unspecified, x defaults to 200. Values

  -warp [<x> <y> | <xy>]  Start a game immediately, warping to ExMy (Doom 
                          1) or MAPxy (Doom 2)

=== Compatibility ===

  -donut <x> <y>          Use the specified magic values when emulating 
                          behavior caused by memory overruns from 
                          improperly constructed donuts. In Vanilla Doom 
                          this can differ depending on the operating 
                          system. The default (if this option is not 
                          specified) is to emulate the behavior when 
                          running under Windows 98.

                          are "1.9", "ultimate", "final", "final2", "hacx" 
                          and "chex".

                          dereference emulation. Supported versions are: 
                          dos622, dos71, dosbox. The default is to emulate 
                          DOS 7.1 (Windows 98).  

  -spechit <n>            Use the specified magic value when emulating 
                          spechit overruns.

                    framerate of the screen.

                   only) 

  -geometry <WxY>  Specify the screen mode (when running fullscreen) or 
                   the window dimensions (when running in windowed mode).  

  -grabmouse       Grab the mouse when running in windowed mode.  

  -height <y>      Specify the screen height, in pixels.

                      server and join it.

                      reducing the amount of network bandwidth needed.  

  -extratics <n>      Send n extra tics in every packet as insurance 
                      against dropped packets.

                      mismatches between the server and the client. Using 
                      this option may cause game desyncs to occur, or

                      of active servers.  

  -server             Start a multiplayer server, listening for 
                      connections.  

  -solo-net           Start the game playing as though in a netgame with a 
                      single player. This can also be used to play back

                     merging a PWAD into the main IWAD. Multiple files may 
                     be specified.
