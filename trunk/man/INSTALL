Chocolate Doom installation
===========================

These are instructions for how to install and set up Chocolate Doom
for play.

Obtaining an IWAD file
----------------------

To play Doom, you need an IWAD file.  This file contains the game data
(graphics, sounds, etc).  The full versions of the Doom games are
proprietary and need to be bought.  The IWAD file has one of the
following names:

   doom1.wad                   (Shareware Doom)
   doom.wad                    (Registered / Ultimate Doom)
   doom2.wad                   (Doom 2)
   tnt.wad                     (Final Doom: TNT: Evilution)
   plutonia.wad                (Final Doom: Plutonia Experiment)
   chex.wad                    (Chex Quest)

If you don't have a copy of a commercial version, you can download
the shareware version (extract the file named doom1.wad):

 * http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=7053
   (idstuff/doom/win95/doom95.zip in your nearest /idgames mirror)

If you have a commercial version, obtaining the IWAD file is usually
straightforward.  The method depends on how you obtained your copy of
the game:

 * The Doom games are available to buy for download on Steam
   (http://www.steampowered.com/).  To find the IWAD files on a
   Windows system, look in the Steam directory (usually within
   "Program Files"), under the "steamapps/common" path.

 * There have been several CD-based versions of Doom.  Generally, the
   IWAD files can be found on the CD and copied off directly.

 * If the IWAD files are not directly available on the CD, or you have
   a floppy disk version, installation is more difficult.  The best
   suggestion is to use a DOS emulator (such as DOSbox) to run the
   installer.

 * As an alternative to using an emulator, it is possible to extract
   the files manually.  On the install disk(s), you will find several
   files with numbered extensions (with CD versions there may be a
   single large file with the extension .1, eg. "resource.1").

   From the command line it is possible to combine these files into a
   single large file, using a command similar to the following:

     cat doom_se.1 doom_se.2 doom_se.3 doom_se.4 doom_se.5 > doom_se.lha

   The resulting file is an LHA archive file, and it can be extracted
   using an LHA archive tool (there is one available for almost every
   operating system).

Running the game
----------------

Chocolate Doom needs to know where to find your IWAD file. To do this,
do one of the following:

 * Run Chocolate Doom from the Unix console with the '-iwad' command
   line parameter to specify the IWAD file to use, eg.

       chocolate-doom -iwad /root/doom2.wad

 * Put the file into one of the following directories:

     /usr/share/games/doom
     /usr/local/share/games/doom

 * Set the environment variable DOOMWADDIR to specify the path to a
   directory containing your IWAD files.

 * If you have multiple IWADs in different directories, set the
   environment variable DOOMWADPATH to be a colon-separated list of
   directories to search (similar to the Unix PATH environment
   variable).

Playing with Chex Quest
-----------------------

Chex Quest is a game based on Doom with some minor modifications that
was distributed with boxes of Chex cereal in 1997.  It is possible to
play Chex Quest using Chocolate Doom.  To do this, the following files
are needed:

 * The IWAD file 'chex.wad', from the Chex Quest CD.

 * The dehacked patch 'chex.deh', which can be found here:
   http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=15420
   (utils/exe_edit/patches/chexdeh.zip in your nearest /idgames mirror)

Copy these files into a directory together and use the '-iwad' command
line parameter to specify the Chex Quest IWAD file:

   chocolate-doom -iwad chex.wad

Installing upgrades
-------------------

Chocolate Doom requires a version 1.9 IWAD file.  Generally, if you
install a recent version of Doom you should have a version 1.9 IWAD.
However, if you are installing from a very old CD version or from
floppy disks, you might find you have an older version.

The most obvious symptom of an out of date IWAD file is that the game
will exit at the title screen before the demo starts, with the message
"Demo is from a different game version!".  If this happens, your IWAD
file is out of date and you need to upgrade.

Id Software released upgrade patches that will update your game to
version 1.9.  The following sites have the patches:

  http://www.doomworld.com/files/patches.shtml
  http://www.doom2.net/doom2/utils.html
  ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/doom2

As the patches are binary patches that run as DOS executables, you
will need to use a DOS emulator (such as DOSBox) to run them.

Music support
-------------

Chocolate Doom includes OPL emulation code that accurately reproduces
the way that the in-game music sounded under DOS when using an
Adlib/Soundblaster card.  This is, however, not to everyone's taste.

As an alternative it is possible to use Timidity for high quality MIDI
playback:

  http://timidity.sourceforge.net/

A good set of patches for Timidity is the eawpats collection, which can
be found here:
